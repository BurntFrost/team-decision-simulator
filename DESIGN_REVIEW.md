# Design Review

This document summarizes the UI/UX review of the project and highlights improvements implemented to align with common best practices from Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Google's Material Design.

## Observations

- The application uses Next.js with Tailwind CSS and custom components for interactive elements such as steppers, sliders and popovers.
- Colors and fonts are defined via CSS variables in `globals.css`, providing theme consistency and support for dark mode.
- Several interactive icons and controls lacked explicit accessibility attributes, which may hinder screen‑reader users.

## Implemented Improvements

- **Accessibility enhancements**
  - Added `role`, `aria-label`, `aria-current`, and `aria-describedby` attributes to stepper and slider components.
  - Marked decorative icons as `aria-hidden` to avoid screen‑reader noise.
  - Provided descriptive labels for info buttons to improve keyboard navigation.
- **Semantic markup**
  - Stepper containers now expose `role="list"` and each step is a `listitem` so assistive technologies can interpret progress correctly.
- These adjustments follow guidance from both Apple and Google for providing accessible, touch-friendly interfaces.

Further improvements could include audit of color contrast, keyboard focus management and testing on real devices.
