# MBTI Brain

A sophisticated decision-making simulation tool that helps teams understand how different personality types approach decisions. This application models the decision-making processes of all 16 MBTI personality types and provides insights into team dynamics and consensus building.

## Features

- **Personality-Based Decision Modeling**: Simulates how each of the 16 MBTI personality types would approach decisions based on their cognitive preferences
- **Factor Analysis**: Evaluates decisions across multiple factors including:
  - Data Quality
  - ROI Visibility
  - Autonomy Scope
  - Time Pressure
  - Social Complexity
- **Visual Analytics**: Provides multiple visualization tools to understand decision patterns:
  - Radar charts for factor comparison
  - Decision flow diagrams
  - Heat maps of personality responses
  - Quadrant analysis of decisiveness vs confidence
- **Public Opinion Simulation**: Models how a diverse group might reach consensus
- **Scenario Testing**: Test different decision scenarios and see how various personality types would respond

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## How It Works

1. **Input Decision Factors**: Adjust sliders to set the importance of different factors in your decision scenario
2. **Run Simulation**: The application will calculate how each MBTI type would likely respond
3. **Analyze Results**: View detailed visualizations of the decision patterns and potential team dynamics
4. **Build Consensus**: Use the insights to understand how to build consensus across different personality types
